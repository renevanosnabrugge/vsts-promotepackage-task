# Description

This task enables you to promote a package in VSTS Package Management to a specific Release View. You can use Release Views to communicate Package Quality as [described here](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/feeds/views). 
In this task, you select the package feed from your account, the package, the version and the Release View to which you want to promote your package. 

* Supports NuGet and NPM
 
Find the task in the Utility category of Build

# Known issues
 * No support for other feedTypes than NuGet and npm

# Documentation
